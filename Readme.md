# Fizz Buzz
I just discovered the Fizz Buzz interview question and I thinking about how I would answer to this question if I was asked to.

I know that my solution is not the best in term of algorithm complexity (here O(n*m)), but it allows us to add as many "FizzBuzz" elements we want and to choose the number of iteration for the loop.
Also, it uses an object oriented structure.
